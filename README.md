# Collatz Conjecture visualizations

The Collatz conjecture states that every natural number will eventually reach 1 under the iteration that each even resulting number is devided by 2, while each odd is multiplied by 3 and then 1 added.
It is also known as the `3x+1`-problem.

You may find more about this at [The Collatz conjecture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mFpVDpKX70) on Youtube.


By running 
`sh run_script.sh 50`
the content of the **output** folder can be created. This includes for example the following digraph and plot.
